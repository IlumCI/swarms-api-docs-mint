This guide provides step-by-step instructions for obtaining and configuring your Swarms API key to access the Swarms platform services.

### Getting Started

#### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Navigate to the official Swarms platform: [https://swarms.world](https://swarms.world/)
2. Complete the registration process by providing the required information
3. Verify your email address to activate your account

**Benefit**: New users automatically receive $20 in free API credits upon successful signup.

#### Step 2: Generate Your API Key

1. Log into your Swarms account
2. Access the API Keys section: [https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys](https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys)
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Assign a descriptive name for your key (recommended for organization)
5. Configure key permissions based on your intended use case
6. Save the generated API key immediately

**Important**: Store your API key securely as it will only be displayed once upon creation.

#### Step 3: Environment Configuration

Immediately after generating your API key, configure it in your environment:

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**

```bash
export SWARMS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

**Option B: Environment File (.env)**

```
SWARMS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

**Security Note**: Never commit API keys to version control systems. Use environment variables or secure configuration management tools.
