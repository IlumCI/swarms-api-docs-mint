# Quickstart

The Swarms API enables you to create and orchestrate AI agents for both single-agent tasks and multi-agent workflows. The platform supports various AI models and provides flexible orchestration patterns for complex problem-solving scenarios.

#### Key Features

* **Single Agent Operations**: Deploy individual AI agents for specific tasks
* **Multi-Agent Swarms**: Coordinate multiple agents working together
* **Sequential Workflows**: Agents work in ordered sequence, building on previous outputs
* **Concurrent Workflows**: Agents work in parallel for faster processing
* **Tools Integration**: Extend agent capabilities with custom functions
* **Multiple Model Support**: Choose from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Groq models

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* Python 3.7+ or Node.js for JavaScript/TypeScript
* An API key from [Swarms Platform](https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys)
* Required libraries installed

#### Installation

**Python:**

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**

```bash
npm install axios dotenv
```

#### Authentication

The API uses API key authentication through the `x-api-key` header. Store your API key securely as an environment variable.

**Base URLs:**

* Production: `https://api.swarms.world`
* Alternative: `https://swarms-api-285321057562.us-east1.run.app`

**Security Note:** Never hardcode API keys in your code. Always use environment variables or secure configuration management.

### Single Agent Usage

Single agents are ideal for focused tasks that don't require collaboration between multiple AI systems.

#### Basic Health Check

Before making API calls, verify your connection:

**Python:**

```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("SWARMS_API_KEY")
BASE_URL = "https://api.swarms.world"

headers = {
    "x-api-key": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/health", headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();
const API_KEY = process.env.SWARMS_API_KEY;
const BASE_URL = 'https://api.swarms.world';

const headers = {
    'x-api-key': API_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

const response = await axios.get(`${BASE_URL}/health`, { headers });
console.log(response.data);
```

#### Creating a Basic Agent

A single agent requires an agent configuration and a task to execute:

**Python:**

```python
def run_single_agent():
    payload = {
        "agent_config": {
            "agent_name": "Research Analyst",
            "description": "An expert in analyzing and synthesizing research data",
            "system_prompt": (
                "You are a Research Analyst with expertise in data analysis and synthesis. "
                "Your role is to analyze provided information, identify key insights, "
                "and present findings in a clear, structured format."
            ),
            "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
            "role": "worker",
            "max_loops": 1,
            "max_tokens": 8192,
            "temperature": 1,
            "auto_generate_prompt": False,
            "tools_list_dictionary": None,
        },
        "task": "What are the key trends in renewable energy adoption?",
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/agent/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    return response.json()
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**

```javascript
async function runSingleAgent() {
    const payload = {
        agent_config: {
            agent_name: "Research Analyst",
            description: "An expert in analyzing and synthesizing research data",
            system_prompt: "You are a Research Analyst with expertise in data analysis and synthesis.",
            model_name: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
            role: "worker",
            max_loops: 1,
            max_tokens: 8192,
            temperature: 1,
            auto_generate_prompt: false,
            tools_list_dictionary: null
        },
        task: "What are the key trends in renewable energy adoption?"
    };

    const response = await axios.post(
        `${BASE_URL}/v1/agent/completions`,
        payload,
        { headers }
    );
    return response.data;
}
```

#### Agent Configuration Parameters

* **agent\_name**: Descriptive name for your agent
* **description**: Brief description of the agent's purpose
* **system\_prompt**: Detailed instructions defining the agent's role and capabilities
* **model\_name**: AI model to use (see supported models section)
* **role**: Agent role, typically "worker"
* **max\_loops**: Maximum number of processing loops
* **max\_tokens**: Maximum response length
* **temperature**: Response creativity (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative)
* **auto\_generate_prompt**: Whether to auto-enhance the system prompt
* **tools\_list_dictionary**: Optional tools for extended functionality

#### Maintaining Conversation History

For multi-turn conversations, include previous messages in the history parameter:

**Python:**

```python
def run_agent_with_history():
    payload = {
        "agent_config": {
            "agent_name": "Conversation Agent",
            "description": "An agent that maintains conversation context",
            "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that maintains context.",
            "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
            "role": "worker",
            "max_loops": 1,
            "max_tokens": 8192,
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "auto_generate_prompt": False,
        },
        "task": "What's the weather like?",
        "history": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "I'm planning a trip to New York."
            },
            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "That's great! When are you planning to visit?"
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Next week."
            }
        ]
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/agent/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    return response.json()
```

### Multi-Agent Swarms

Multi-agent swarms enable complex problem-solving by coordinating multiple AI agents. Swarms support two primary workflow types:

#### Workflow Types

**Sequential Workflow:** Agents execute in order, with each agent building upon the previous agent's output. This is ideal for tasks requiring step-by-step processing.

**Concurrent Workflow:** Agents work simultaneously on the same task, providing parallel processing for faster results and diverse perspectives.

#### Sequential Workflow Example

Sequential workflows are perfect for analysis pipelines where each step depends on the previous one:

**Python:**

```python
def run_sequential_swarm():
    payload = {
        "name": "Financial Analysis Swarm",
        "description": "Market analysis swarm",
        "agents": [
            {
                "agent_name": "Market Analyst",
                "description": "Analyzes market trends",
                "system_prompt": "You are a financial analyst expert specializing in market trend analysis.",
                "model_name": "gpt-4o",
                "role": "worker",
                "max_loops": 1,
                "max_tokens": 8192,
                "temperature": 0.5,
                "auto_generate_prompt": False
            },
            {
                "agent_name": "Economic Forecaster",
                "description": "Predicts economic trends",
                "system_prompt": "You are an expert in economic forecasting. Use the market analysis to provide economic predictions.",
                "model_name": "gpt-4o",
                "role": "worker",
                "max_loops": 1,
                "max_tokens": 8192,
                "temperature": 0.5,
                "auto_generate_prompt": False
            }
        ],
        "max_loops": 1,
        "swarm_type": "SequentialWorkflow",
        "task": "Analyze the current market conditions and provide economic forecasts."
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/swarm/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    return response.json()
```

#### Concurrent Workflow Example

Concurrent workflows are ideal when you need multiple perspectives or parallel processing:

**Python:**

```python
def run_concurrent_swarm():
    payload = {
        "name": "Medical Analysis Swarm",
        "description": "Analyzes medical data concurrently",
        "agents": [
            {
                "agent_name": "Lab Data Analyzer",
                "description": "Analyzes lab report data",
                "system_prompt": "You are a medical data analyst specializing in lab results interpretation.",
                "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
                "role": "worker",
                "max_loops": 1,
                "max_tokens": 8192,
                "temperature": 0.5,
                "auto_generate_prompt": False
            },
            {
                "agent_name": "Clinical Specialist",
                "description": "Provides clinical interpretations",
                "system_prompt": "You are an expert in clinical diagnosis and patient care recommendations.",
                "model_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
                "role": "worker",
                "max_loops": 1,
                "max_tokens": 8192,
                "temperature": 0.5,
                "auto_generate_prompt": False
            }
        ],
        "max_loops": 1,
        "swarm_type": "ConcurrentWorkflow",
        "task": "Analyze these lab results and provide clinical interpretations."
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/swarm/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    return response.json()
```

#### Batch Processing

Process multiple swarms in a single request for improved efficiency:

**Python:**

```python
def run_batch_swarms():
    payload = [
        {
            "name": "Research Swarm",
            "description": "Conducts comprehensive research",
            "agents": [
                {
                    "agent_name": "Research Agent",
                    "description": "Conducts initial research",
                    "system_prompt": "You are a research assistant specializing in comprehensive data gathering.",
                    "model_name": "gpt-4",
                    "role": "worker",
                    "max_loops": 1,
                    "max_tokens": 8192,
                    "temperature": 0.7,
                    "auto_generate_prompt": False
                },
                {
                    "agent_name": "Analysis Agent",
                    "description": "Analyzes research data",
                    "system_prompt": "You are a data analyst who synthesizes research findings.",
                    "model_name": "gpt-4",
                    "role": "worker",
                    "max_loops": 1,
                    "max_tokens": 8192,
                    "temperature": 0.7,
                    "auto_generate_prompt": False
                }
            ],
            "max_loops": 1,
            "swarm_type": "SequentialWorkflow",
            "task": "Research recent AI advancements and provide analysis."
        }
    ]

    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/swarm/batch/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    return response.json()
```

### Advanced Features

#### Tools Integration

Enhance agent capabilities by providing specialized tools. Tools are defined using OpenAPI-style function specifications:

**Python:**

```python
def run_agent_with_tools():
    tools_dictionary = [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "search_topic",
                "description": "Conduct an in-depth search on a specific topic",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "depth": {
                            "type": "integer",
                            "description": "Search depth level (1-3, where 3 is most comprehensive)"
                        },
                        "detailed_queries": {
                            "type": "array",
                            "description": "List of specific search queries to execute",
                            "items": {
                                "type": "string"
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["depth", "detailed_queries"]
                }
            }
        }
    ]

    payload = {
        "agent_config": {
            "agent_name": "Research Assistant",
            "description": "Expert researcher with advanced search capabilities",
            "system_prompt": "You are a research assistant with access to advanced search tools. Use the search_topic function when you need to gather comprehensive information.",
            "model_name": "gpt-4",
            "role": "worker",
            "max_loops": 1,
            "max_tokens": 8192,
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "auto_generate_prompt": False,
            "tools_dictionary": tools_dictionary
        },
        "task": "Research the latest developments in quantum computing and provide a comprehensive analysis."
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/agent/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    return response.json()
```

#### Tool Definition Guidelines

### Best Practices

#### Security

* Never commit API keys to version control
* Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
* Implement proper access controls in production environments
* Regularly rotate API keys

#### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for production applications:

**Python:**

```python
import time
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt

@retry(
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10),
    stop=stop_after_attempt(3)
)
def make_api_call(payload):
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            f"{BASE_URL}/v1/agent/completions",
            headers=headers,
            json=payload,
            timeout=30
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"API call failed: {e}")
        raise

def validate_payload(payload):
    required_fields = ["agent_config", "task"]
    if not all(field in payload for field in required_fields):
        raise ValueError("Missing required fields in payload")
    
    agent_config = payload["agent_config"]
    required_config_fields = ["agent_name", "system_prompt", "model_name"]
    if not all(field in agent_config for field in required_config_fields):
        raise ValueError("Missing required fields in agent_config")
```

#### Rate Limiting

* Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
* Monitor your API usage to stay within limits
* Use batch processing when possible to reduce individual request volume

#### Performance Optimization

* Cache responses when appropriate
* Use concurrent workflows for independent tasks
* Choose the right model for your specific use case
* Optimize token usage by being specific in your prompts

#### Testing Strategy

* Start with simple, single-agent tasks
* Test with different models to find the best fit
* Gradually increase complexity as you understand the system
* Implement comprehensive logging for debugging

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors:**

* Verify your API key is correct and active
* Check that the `x-api-key` header is properly set
* Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

**Timeout Issues:**

* Increase request timeout values
* Consider breaking complex tasks into smaller chunks
* Use batch processing for multiple operations

**Model Availability:**

* Check if your requested model is currently available
* Have fallback models configured
* Monitor model status through the health endpoint
