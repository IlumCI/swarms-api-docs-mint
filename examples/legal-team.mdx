# Legal Document Review Swarm

This example demonstrates how to create a sequential workflow swarm for comprehensive legal document analysis. The swarm includes multiple specialized legal agents that work in sequence to analyze contracts, agreements, and legal documents systematically.

## What This Example Shows

- Creating a sequential workflow swarm for step-by-step analysis
- Implementing multiple specialized legal expert agents
- Coordinating agents to work in a specific order
- Comprehensive legal document review and analysis

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install -U swarms-client
```

## Swarm Architecture Explained

### Sequential Workflow

This swarm type processes agents in a specific order:
1. **Structure Analyst**: Reviews document organization first
2. **Party Identifier**: Identifies involved parties based on structure
3. **Clause Extractor**: Extracts terms after understanding parties
4. **Ambiguity Checker**: Reviews language after understanding content
5. **Compliance Reviewer**: Final review after full document analysis

### Agent Specializations

- **Structure Analyst**: Document organization and flow
- **Party Identifier**: Legal entity identification and roles
- **Clause Extractor**: Key terms and standard clauses
- **Ambiguity Checker**: Risk assessment and language clarity
- **Compliance Reviewer**: Regulatory and legal standard compliance

## Expected Output

The sequential swarm will provide:
- **Structured Analysis**: Step-by-step document review
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of the legal document
- **Risk Assessment**: Identification of potential legal issues
- **Compliance Review**: Regulatory and best practice adherence
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific improvements and clarifications

## Use Cases

This pattern is ideal for:
- **Contract Review**: Service agreements, employment contracts, NDAs
- **Legal Compliance**: Regulatory documentation, policy reviews
- **Due Diligence**: Merger and acquisition document analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying legal vulnerabilities and ambiguities
- **Document Standardization**: Ensuring consistent legal language

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
SWARMS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Customization Ideas

Adapt this pattern for:
- **Financial Documents**: Loan agreements, investment contracts
- **Real Estate**: Purchase agreements, lease contracts
- **Intellectual Property**: Licensing agreements, patent documentation
- **Employment Law**: HR policies, employment contracts
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Industry-specific compliance documents

## Next Steps

After mastering sequential workflows, explore:
- Concurrent workflows for parallel analysis
- Hierarchical swarms for team coordination
- Majority voting for consensus-based decisions
- Agent routing for dynamic task distribution
