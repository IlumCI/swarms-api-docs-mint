# Single Agent Overview

This example demonstrates how to create and run a single AI agent for specialized tasks. We'll create a medical diagnosis agent that can interpret blood work results.

## What This Example Shows

- Creating a single agent with specific expertise
- Configuring agent parameters (model, temperature, tokens)
- Running agents with structured tasks
- Handling agent responses and outputs

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install -U swarms-client
```

## Get Your Swarms API Key

1. Visit [https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys](https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store it securely in your environment variables

## Code

```python
import os
from swarms_client import SwarmsClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import json

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the client
client = SwarmsClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("SWARMS_API_KEY"),
)

# Create and run a single agent
result = client.agent.run(
    agent_config={
        "agent_name": "Bloodwork Diagnosis Expert",
        "description": "An expert doctor specializing in interpreting and diagnosing blood work results.",
        "system_prompt": (
            "You are an expert medical doctor specializing in the interpretation and diagnosis of blood work. "
            "Your expertise includes analyzing laboratory results, identifying abnormal values, "
            "explaining their clinical significance, and recommending next diagnostic or treatment steps. "
            "Provide clear, evidence-based explanations and consider differential diagnoses based on blood test findings."
        ),
        "model_name": "groq/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct",
        "max_loops": 1,
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "temperature": 0.5,
    },
    task=(
        "A patient presents with the following blood work results: "
        "Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL (low), WBC: 13,000 /µL (high), Platelets: 180,000 /µL (normal), "
        "ALT: 65 U/L (high), AST: 70 U/L (high). "
        "Please provide a detailed interpretation, possible diagnoses, and recommended next steps."
    ),
)

print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))
```

## Agent Configuration Explained

- **agent_name**: A descriptive name for your agent
- **description**: What the agent does
- **system_prompt**: The agent's expertise and behavior instructions
- **model_name**: The AI model to use (supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and more)
- **max_loops**: Maximum reasoning iterations (1 for single-pass tasks)
- **max_tokens**: Maximum response length
- **temperature**: Creativity level (0.0 = focused, 1.0 = creative)

## Expected Output

The agent will provide a structured medical analysis including:
- Interpretation of each blood value
- Possible diagnoses based on the results
- Recommended next steps for the patient
- Clinical context and significance

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
SWARMS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Customization Ideas

You can adapt this pattern for:
- **Legal Analysis**: Contract review agents
- **Code Review**: Software quality assurance agents
- **Content Creation**: Writing and editing agents
- **Data Analysis**: Business intelligence agents
- **Customer Support**: FAQ and troubleshooting agents

## Next Steps

After mastering single agents, explore:
- Multi-agent swarms for complex workflows
- Batch processing for multiple tasks
- Agent chaining for sequential reasoning
