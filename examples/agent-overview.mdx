## What This Example Shows

- Creating a single agent with specific expertise
- Configuring agent parameters (model, temperature, tokens)
- Running agents with structured tasks
- Handling agent responses and outputs

<Info>
Single agents are the building blocks of the Swarms API. Each agent can be configured with specific models, temperatures, and expertise areas.

## Quick Start

    ```python
    import os
from swarms_client import SwarmsClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import json

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the client
client = SwarmsClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("SWARMS_API_KEY"),
)

# Create and run a single agent
result = client.agent.run(

## Agent Configuration Explained

- **agent_name**: A descriptive name for your agent
- **description**: What the agent does
- **system_prompt**: The agent's expertise and behavior instructions
- **model_name**: The AI model to use (supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and more)
- **max_loops**: Maximum reasoning iterations (1 for single-pass tasks)
- **max_tokens**: Maximum response length
- **temperature**: Creativity level (0.0 = focused, 1.0 = creative)

## Expected Output

The agent will provide a structured medical analysis including:
- Interpretation of each blood value
- Possible diagnoses based on the results
- Recommended next steps for the patient
- Clinical context and significance

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
SWARMS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Customization Ideas

You can adapt this pattern for:
- **Legal Analysis**: Contract review agents
- **Code Review**: Software quality assurance agents
- **Content Creation**: Writing and editing agents
- **Data Analysis**: Business intelligence agents
- **Customer Support**: FAQ and troubleshooting agents

## Next Steps

After mastering single agents, explore:
- Multi-agent swarms for complex workflows
- Batch processing for multiple tasks
- Agent chaining for sequential reasoning
