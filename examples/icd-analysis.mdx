pip3 install -U swarms-client
```

## Get Your Swarms API Key

1. Visit [https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys](https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store it securely in your environment variables

## Code

```python
import json
import os
from swarms_client import SwarmsClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the client
client = SwarmsClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("SWARMS_API_KEY"),
)

# Example patient symptoms for analysis
patient_symptoms = """
Patient: 45-year-old female
Chief Complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath for 2 days

Symptoms:
- Sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breathing
- Shortness of breath, especially when lying down
- Mild fever (100.2Â°F)
- Dry cough
- Fatigue
"""

## Swarm Architecture Explained

### Concurrent Workflow

This swarm type processes all agents simultaneously:
- **ICD-Analyzer**: Analyzes and identifies relevant ICD codes
- **ICD-Code-Explainer-Primary**: Provides primary code explanations
- **ICD-Code-Explainer-Secondary**: Offers additional context and nuances

### Benefits of Concurrent Processing

- **Speed**: All agents work simultaneously for faster results
- **Efficiency**: No waiting for sequential completion
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple perspectives delivered together
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more parallel agents

## Expected Output

The concurrent swarm will provide:
- **ICD Code Analysis**: Relevant medical codes for the symptoms
- **Primary Explanations**: Clear, clinical context for each code
- **Secondary Context**: Additional insights, differential diagnoses, and related codes
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple perspectives on the same medical case

## Use Cases

This pattern is ideal for:
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Symptom analysis and code identification
- **Clinical Documentation**: Medical record coding and validation
- **Medical Education**: Teaching ICD code interpretation
- **Healthcare Billing**: Accurate medical code assignment
- **Clinical Research**: Medical condition classification and analysis

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
SWARMS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Customization Ideas

Adapt this pattern for:
- **Radiology Analysis**: Multiple imaging specialists working in parallel
- **Laboratory Results**: Multiple lab technicians analyzing different tests
- **Pharmaceutical Review**: Multiple pharmacists reviewing medication interactions
- **Surgical Planning**: Multiple specialists planning surgical procedures
- **Emergency Response**: Multiple emergency responders coordinating care

## Advanced Concurrent Workflows

You can extend this pattern to:
- **Dynamic Agent Allocation**: Automatically assign agents based on workload
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute tasks evenly across available agents
- **Result Aggregation**: Combine parallel results into unified insights
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple agents validating each other's work

## Next Steps

After mastering concurrent workflows, explore:
- Sequential workflows for dependent tasks
- Hierarchical swarms for team coordination
- Majority voting for consensus-based decisions
- Agent routing for intelligent task distribution
- Mixture of agents for specialized expertise combinations
