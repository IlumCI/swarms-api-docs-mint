The Swarms API provides a comprehensive multi-tier architecture for building intelligent AI systems. The platform is designed around three distinct agent paradigms, each optimized for different types of tasks and complexity levels.

### Architecture Tiers

| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1** | Individual Agents  | 1              | Low-Medium  | Focused tasks        | Content generation, data analysis, Q\&A           | `/v1/agent/completions`           |
| **Tier 2** | Reasoning Agents   | 1-2 (internal) | Medium-High | Complex reasoning    | Mathematical proofs, logical validation, research | `/v1/reasoning-agent/completions` |

* **Cost**: $0.01-0.10 per request
* **Memory**: Minimal

#### Reasoning Agents

* **Latency**: 5-30 seconds
* **Throughput**: Medium (100-500 requests/minute)
* **Cost**: $0.05-0.50 per request
* **Memory**: Moderate

#### Multi-Agent Swarms

* **Latency**: 30 seconds - 10 minutes

* **Memory**: High

### Best Practices

#### 1. Start with the Right Tier

* Begin with individual agents for simple tasks
* Upgrade to reasoning agents when complexity increases
* Use swarms only when necessary for scale

#### 2. Optimize for Your Use Case

* Match agent capabilities to task requirements
* Consider cost vs. performance trade-offs
* Plan for scalability from the start

#### 3. Monitor and Iterate

* Track performance metrics across all tiers
* Optimize based on usage patterns
* Consider hybrid approaches for complex needs
