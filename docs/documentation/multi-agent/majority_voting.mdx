---

**Swarm Type**: `MajorityVoting`

## Overview

The MajorityVoting swarm type implements a democratic decision-making process where multiple agents independently analyze a problem and propose solutions. The final outcome is determined by majority consensus, making this architecture ideal for scenarios where you want to leverage collective intelligence while maintaining a clear decision-making process.

Key features:
- **Democratic Decision Making**: Multiple agents vote on solutions
- **Consensus Building**: Majority rule determines final outcome
- **Independent Analysis**: Each agent works independently before voting
- **Transparent Process**: Clear voting mechanism and results

## Use Cases

- Content quality assessment and approval
- Problem diagnosis with multiple expert opinions
- Decision-making in uncertain scenarios
- Quality control and validation processes

## API Usage

## Best Practices

- Use an odd number of agents to avoid tie votes
- Design agents with distinct evaluation criteria
- Ensure clear voting instructions in system prompts
- Ideal for quality control and approval workflows
