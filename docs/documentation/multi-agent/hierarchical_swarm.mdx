description: "Multi-level swarm architecture with supervisor agents coordinating specialized worker agents in a hierarchical structure"
---

**Swarm Type**: `HierarchicalSwarm`

## Overview

The HierarchicalSwarm implements a multi-level organizational structure where supervisor agents coordinate and manage specialized worker agents. This architecture mirrors real-world organizational hierarchies, allowing for complex task decomposition, quality control, and efficient resource allocation across multiple levels of responsibility.

Key features:
- **Multi-Level Structure**: Supervisor and worker agent hierarchy
- **Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks broken down into manageable subtasks
- **Quality Control**: Supervisors oversee and validate worker outputs
- **Resource Coordination**: Efficient allocation and management of agent resources

## Use Cases

- Complex project management and coordination
- Multi-stage research and analysis workflows
- Content creation with editorial oversight
- Quality assurance and validation processes

## API Usage

### Basic HierarchicalSwarm Example
