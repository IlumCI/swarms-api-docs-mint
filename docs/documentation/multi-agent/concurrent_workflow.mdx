name: "ConcurrentWorkflow"
description: "Parallel execution swarm that runs independent tasks simultaneously for faster processing and improved efficiency"
---

**Swarm Type**: `ConcurrentWorkflow`

## Overview

The ConcurrentWorkflow swarm type runs independent tasks in parallel, significantly reducing processing time for complex operations. This architecture is ideal for tasks that can be processed simultaneously without dependencies, allowing multiple agents to work on different aspects of a problem at the same time.

Key features:
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Reduced Processing Time**: Faster completion through parallelization
- **Independent Tasks**: Agents work on separate, non-dependent subtasks
- **Scalable Performance**: Performance scales with the number of agents

## Use Cases

- Independent data analysis tasks
- Parallel content generation
- Multi-source research projects
- Distributed problem solving

## API Usage

## Best Practices

- Design independent tasks that don't require sequential dependencies
- Use for tasks that can be parallelized effectively
- Ensure agents have distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities
- Ideal for time-sensitive analysis requiring multiple perspectives
