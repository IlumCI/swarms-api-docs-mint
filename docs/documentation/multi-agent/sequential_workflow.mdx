**Swarm Type**: `SequentialWorkflow`

## Overview

The SequentialWorkflow swarm type executes tasks in a strict, predefined order where each step depends on the completion of the previous one. This architecture is perfect for workflows that require a linear progression of tasks, ensuring that each agent builds upon the work of the previous agent.

Key features:
- **Ordered Execution**: Agents execute in a specific, predefined sequence
- **Step Dependencies**: Each step builds upon previous results
- **Predictable Flow**: Clear, linear progression through the workflow
- **Quality Control**: Each agent can validate and enhance previous work

## Use Cases

- Document processing pipelines
- Multi-stage analysis workflows
- Content creation and editing processes
- Data transformation and validation pipelines

## API Usage

## Best Practices

- Design workflows with clear dependencies between steps
- Use for tasks that require sequential processing
- Ensure each agent builds upon previous results effectively
- Ideal for quality control and validation workflows
