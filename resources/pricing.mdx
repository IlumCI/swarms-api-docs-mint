### Example Calculation

For a swarm with 3 agents, 500,000 input tokens, 200,000 output tokens, and 2 images (standard tier):

* Agent cost: 3 × $0.01 = $0.03
* Input token cost: 0.5 × $3.00 = $1.50
* Output token cost: 0.2 × $15.00 = $3.00
* Image cost: 2 × $0.25 = $0.50
* **Total:** $0.03 + $1.50 + $3.00 + $0.50 = **$5.03**

### Deductions

* Credits are deducted from your account for each API call based on the above rates.
* Free credits are used first, then regular credits.
* If you use an MCP URL, an additional $0.10 is deducted per call.

### Flex Tier

* Flex tier offers a 75% discount on token costs but may have higher latency or retries.

### Night-time Discount

* 75% discount on token costs between 8pm and 6am California time.
