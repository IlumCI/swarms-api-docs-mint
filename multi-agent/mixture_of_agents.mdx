**Swarm Type**: `MixtureOfAgents`

## Overview

The MixtureOfAgents swarm type brings together multiple specialized agents to work collaboratively on the same task. This architecture leverages the collective intelligence and diverse perspectives of multiple agents, combining their expertise to produce more comprehensive and nuanced solutions than any single agent could achieve alone.

Key features:
- **Collaborative Analysis**: Multiple agents work together on the same task
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Different viewpoints and expertise areas
- **Comprehensive Solutions**: Combined insights from multiple specialists
- **Enhanced Quality**: Better results through collective intelligence

## Use Cases

- Complex problem analysis requiring multiple viewpoints
- Content creation with multiple expert perspectives
- Research projects needing interdisciplinary approaches
- Decision-making with diverse stakeholder input

## API Usage

## Best Practices

- Design agents with complementary but distinct expertise areas
- Use for complex tasks requiring multiple perspectives
- Ensure agents can work collaboratively on the same problem
- Ideal for comprehensive analysis and decision-making
